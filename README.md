# Tackling Word-Level Sign Language Recognition over space and time


This repository contains the code for our WLASL project, which aims to classify American Sign Language (ASL) signs using a combination of ResNetRNN and Dense Graph Convolutional Network (DGCN) models.

## Installation

Clone this repository and install the required packages using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shankhsuri/Sign-Language-Decoding.git
cd Sign-Language-Decoding
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the project, simply execute the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```
This will start the entire pipeline for the WLASL project, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
